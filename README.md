# GoProject

## Introduction

My name is David Clarke, I am an 3rd year student in Software Development. In one of my modules Graph Theory, I was asked to design a project that is worth 50% of the overall mudule grade. This project contains a Go program that can execute regular expressions against strings over the alphabet 0, 1 and with the special characters ., |, and âˆ—. We have to create a program that can turn a regular expression into postfix notation, and then into a non deterministic finite automota. It was written in Visual Studio Code in GoLang. 

## User Instructions

To run the program in visual studio code, the user must select "Ctrl" and ' to open up the terminal. In the terminal the user must type "go build GoProject.go" to build the program and must type "go run GoProject.go" to compile and run the code.

## Project Workings

Before starting this project, I read the brief and specs thoroughly and then watched the videos that were posted weekly on the moodle page. Understanding how the project works was essential before starting. The shunt coding video was what I heavily referenced my work on and pulled from.
