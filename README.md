# GoProject

## Introduction

My name is David Clarke, I am an 3rd year in Software Development. In one of my modules Graph Theory, I was asked to design a project that is worth 50% of the overall mudule grade. This project contains a Go program that can execute regular expressions against strings over the alphabet 0, 1 and with the special characters ., |, and âˆ—. It was written in Visual Studio Code in GoLang.
